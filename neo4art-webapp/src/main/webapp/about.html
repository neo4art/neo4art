				<h1>About the project</h1>
				<p>
					The <strong>ARTS</strong> are a manifestation of our creative impulse, meant to make the observer <strong>feel emotions</strong>.<br/> Think
					for example of the emotions you feel when you receive a drawing from your children, when you listen to a song of your favourite artist
					or when you visit towns such as Venice, Paris, London or Berlin. That's the reason why we have decided to create something that can
					help you to get in touch with the arts and finally to <em>let you feel emotions.</em> <br/>After all we are from <strong>Italy, the
						cradle of art!</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					This is the reason why we created <span class="bigger"><strong>neo4<span class="palette-dark-blue">A</span><span
							class="palette-blue">r</span><span class="palette-orange">t</span></strong></span>
				</p>
				<p>This project will be quite different from more traditional existing art portals because we are mainly focused upon connections
					between every kind of topics regarding the arts.</p>
					<h2>Connected informations</h2>
				<p>
					<em>What does "connected information" mean and why are we so interested in them?</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Well, every time you click a link in an internet page, you are indeed declaring your interest in a connected information.<br> The
					same way, what we want to achieve through <span class="bigger"><strong>neo4<span class="palette-dark-blue">A</span><span
							class="palette-blue">r</span><span class="palette-orange">t</span></strong></span>, is to automatically discover new topics you could be interested
					in, by <strong>traversing art through its connections</strong>.

				<p>
				Let us just take an example. Suppose you are planning your vacation in Paris.<br>If you love the famous post-impressionist painter
				<strong>Vincent Van Gogh</strong> you probably will not miss his masterpieces from the Musée d'Orsay for no reason at all. In that
				museum you can admire his "La Siesta".<br> <strong>Do you know</strong> that it's a copy of one of his biggest influencers <em>Juan-Fran&ccedil;ois
					Millet</em>, who was indeed a realist?<br> <strong>Do you know</strong> that the his canvas is exposed at the Boston Museum of Fine
				Arts?<br> <strong>Do you know</strong> that in the same museum you can also see Millet's artwork "The Angelus", which became an
				obsession for the Spanish surrealist painter <strong>Salvador Dal&igrave;</strong>, who performed various re-interpretations of the same
				topic and also wrote an essay entitled "The tragic mith of Millet's Angelus"?<br>Once again, while observing Gauguin's artworks,
				wouldn't be interesting to know that <strong>Van Gogh and Gauguin lived together in Arles</strong>?<br>There, Gauguin painted "The
				painter of sunflower", which is a portrait of Van Gogh. Van Gogh insteadr painted "Paul Gaugin's armchair".<br> <strong>Do
					you know</strong> that both are exposed at the <em>Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam</em> as well?
				</p>
				<div class="img-float-left">
					<figure>
						<img src="resources/img/la-siesta-millet.jpg" class="border-three-color" />
						<figcaption>The original painted by Millet</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>
					Those are simple examples that demonstrate how these topics are so <strong>strictly connected</strong> and how much we can <strong>learn
						from them.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Luckily, technology can help us to do more complex analysis. We are going to implement a <strong>sentiments analysis</strong> on Van
					Gogh's letters to understand his mood while he was painting his artworks, and to answer the question about which paintings he realised
					while feeling whether happy or sad.<br> Furthermore colour analysis can help us to understand how much the artist was influenced
					by Peter Paul Rubens while staying in Antwerp. Indeed, we know that he gained encouragement to broaden his palette to carmine, cobalt,
					and emerald green.
				</p>
				<p>
					By connecting our system to <strong>social networks</strong>, we could understand what the web is talking about. For example, if people
					that "like" Musée D'Orsay, as you do, also "like" Marmottan Monet Museum, we could recommend you to visit another museum that you could
					not know, or we could suggest you to go to Monet's house in Giverny, a few kilometres outside Paris, that is where he painted most of
					his masterpieces, or also the lake he built to paint his famous "Ninfee", which are currently exposed in Paris.
				</p>
				<p>These are all examples of what we consider connections. A really powerful tool that can help us to understand art better, by
					traversing it from different perspectives.</p>
					<h2>Technology</h2>

				<p>
					The underlying technology we're going to use is <a href="http://www.neo4j.com">neo4j</a>, an opensource <strong>graph database</strong>,
					that is ideal for managing interconnected data. The amazing thing is that Neo4j works at an incredible speed! You might have already
					heard about graph databases, in fact social networks such as Facebook and Twitter are built on top of them in order to manage
					connections between you and your friends, groups that you follow and things that you "like". Neo4j is the solution that better supports
					our purpose of improving knowledge about art by discovering connected information.
				</p>
				<p>
					We're here also to ask for your help since we are kickstarting this great art project called <span class="bigger"><strong>neo4<span
							class="palette-dark-blue">A</span><span class="palette-blue">r</span><span class="palette-orange">t</span></strong></span>. As for Wikipedia, our
					project will be accessible to the community for free.
