# Wikipedia Structures

As you may know wikipedia pages are grouped into `categories`.
The category we are most interested in is of course http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Arts[Category:Arts]
and some of its sub-categories are really useful for `neo4art`.
As a very basic approach, wikipedia categories could become http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/graphdb-neo4j-labels.html[neo4j labels].

Another interesting structure element of a wikipedia page are `templates`.
As you can read, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Templates[templates]
_are pages that are embedded (transcluded) into other pages to allow for the repetition of information_,
but from our point of view template are really useful to find specific information regarding the topic presented in a specific page.
For example the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_person[Infobox person] template contains really useful information about people: _birth_name_, _birth_date_, _birth_place_,
while the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_settlement[Infobox settlement] template contains information about cities
and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Coord[Coord] template contains geospatial data.
From our point of view, wikipedia templates will become http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/rest-api-node-properties.html[neo4j node properties].
