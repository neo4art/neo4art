Letter|[Letterhead: Goupil The Hague]
The Hague, 24 March 1873
My dear Theo,
Would you mind checking whether a painting by Schotel is still in Brussels?
It was sent from here on consignment on 6 May 1870, but perhaps Uncle has already sent it back to Paris.
If that isn’t the case, however, see that it’s sent here immediately.
  We have every chance of selling it, but time is of the essence.
I saw it last summer in your gallery, and imagine it’s probably still there.
Bid good-day to Uncle and Aunt and Mr Schmidt and Eduard for me.
You’ll have received my letter by now. Adieu, I wish you well.
Vincent
