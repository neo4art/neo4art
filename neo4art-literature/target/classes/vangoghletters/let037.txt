Letter|[Letterhead: Goupil Paris]
Paris, 6 July 1875
My dear Theo,
Thanks for writing, yes, old boy, I thought so. You must write and tell me sometime how your English is, have you done anything about it? If not, it’s not such a great disaster.
I’ve rented a small room in Montmartre which you’d like; it’s small, but overlooks a little garden full of ivy and Virginia creeper.
I want to tell you which prints I have on the wall.
Ruisdael  	The bush
 	Bleaching fields
Rembrandt	 	Reading the Bible (a large, old Dutch room, (in the evening, a candle on the table) in which a young mother sits beside her child’s cradle reading the Bible; an old woman listens, it’s something that recalls: Verily I say unto you, ‘for where 2 or 3 are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them’, it’s an old copper engraving, as large as ‘The bush’, superb).
P. de Champaigne	 	Portrait of a lady
 
﻿ Corot  	Evening
 
Bodmer	 	Fontainebleau
Bonington	 	A road
Troyon	 	Morning
Jules Dupré	 	Evening (resting place)
Maris	 	Washerwoman
 	A baptism
Millet	 	The four times of the day
 	 	(woodcuts, 4 prints)
Van der Maaten	 	Funeral in the cornfield
Daubigny	 	Dawn (cock crowing)
Charlet	 	Hospitality. Farmhouse surrounded by fir trees, winter scene with snow. A peasant and a soldier before a door.
Ed. Frère	 	Seamstresses
 	A cooper
Well, old boy, keep well, you know it, longsuffering and meek, as much as possible. Let us remain good friends.
Adieu
Vincent
