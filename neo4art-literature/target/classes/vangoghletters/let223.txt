Letter|This day I have sent to you by book-post 1 drawing, ‘A root in a dry ground’. You just let me know what you think of it. Roots is very similar to this one but I can’t sent that one neither ‘Sorrow’ in this manner on a roller, the drawings being mounted on cardboard. With regard to this one I hammered it off in a single day, having studied the same spot and trees for Roots. So it’s been done ‘in one go’ out of doors and hasn’t even been in my studio.
But the paper has been slightly damaged in 2 or 3 places as I worked through it, please have this seen to at once, else it might get worse. I think it wants a grey mount. Good bye, hope to hear of you at yr early convenience.
Vincent
Tuesday evening
