Letter|Dordrecht, 8 March 1877
My dear Uncle,
When Pa was here recently he told me that you had asked whether Theo and I could come and see you some day.
I long so much to see and talk to you and Aunt again, and so I’d like to ask if it would be convenient for you if Theo and I came next Sunday with the first train from The Hague, and stayed with you until the afternoon or evening.
Theo has to go on a trip soon, and if we don’t do it now it may not be possible for a long time.
It was a wonderful day when Pa was here recently; we took a walk together and also went to the museum to see the paintings by Scheffer. I’m doing well here, at the beginning of the year there’s a lot of work in the shop, so I’m there until 12 or 1 o’clock at night.
I’m happy to be back in Holland, only I loved the work over there – even with all the trouble and deep disappointment connected with it – and continue to do so, and the disappointment and, for once, relative failure make me deeply attached to it.
 
It’s wonderful that Anna has found another situation straightaway; I only hope it will be to her liking.
If it’s all right with you that Theo and I come next Sunday, please write a postcard to one of us, and believe me meanwhile, after warm regards to and Aunt
Your loving nephew
Vincent
I would have written to you about this earlier if Pa hadn’t asked me only yesterday to go next Sunday.
