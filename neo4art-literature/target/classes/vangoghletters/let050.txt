Letter|[Letterhead: Goupil Paris]
Paris, 25 Sept. 1875
My dear Theo,
The way is narrow, so we must be careful. You know how others have arrived where we wish to go; let us take that simple path as well. ora et labora.
Let us do our daily work, whatever the hand finds to do, with all our might, and let us believe that God will give good gifts, a part that shall not be taken away, to those who pray to Him for it. And let us trust in God with all our heart and lean not unto our own understanding. God’s will and not ours.
‘Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new’. II Cor. 5:18.
I’m going to get rid of all my books by Michelet &amp;c. &amp;c., you should too.
How I’m longing for Christmas, but let’s be patient, that time will come soon enough.
Keep well, old chap, and give my regards to all my acquaintances, and believe me
Your loving brother
Vincent
 
I’ll send the money for the frames as soon as possible; when I write to Mr Tersteeg I’ll tell him that I don’t have much money at the moment, because I’ve asked our cashier to keep back part of my monthly wages as I’ll be needing a good deal of money around Christmas for my trip &amp;c.
I hope, though, that it won’t be so very long before I can send it.
If I were you I wouldn’t go to Borchers all that often.
 
Don’t you find these words beautiful? I Cor 2:4 and 5
For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
