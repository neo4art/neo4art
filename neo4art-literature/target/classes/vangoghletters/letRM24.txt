Letter|Dear brother and ,
My impression is that as we’re all a little dazed, and moreover all working quite hard, it’s relatively unimportant to insist on having very clear-cut definitions of the position in which we find ourselves. You surprise me a little, seeming to want to force the situation, being in disagreement.
 
Can I do anything about it – perhaps not – but have I done something wrong, or anyway can I do something or other that you would like?
Whatever the case, again a good handshake in thought – and it nevertheless gave me a lot of pleasure to see you all again. Be very much assured of that.
Yours truly,
V.
