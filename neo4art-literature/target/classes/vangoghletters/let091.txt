Letter|My dear Theo,
Van Iterson just came and surprised me, I think it’s nice that he came, but it’s as though he were a person from another world, so much lies between the time when we were in the firm together and now.
Herewith the ‘Wijde wijde wereld’ and another little book, give one of them to Caroline.
How much I’d like you to be able to see it here.
I hope to walk to London on Saturday morning at 4 o’clock to visit Gladwell and others. I wish you could walk along with me.
A hearty handshake in thought. Adieu, believe me,
Your most loving brother
Vincent
