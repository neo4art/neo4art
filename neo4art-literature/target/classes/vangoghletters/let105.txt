Letter|When the Lord’s Supper is next celebrated here I’ll attend it, you should do the same in The Hague, let us go as true participants in the Lord’s Supper.
And take this piece of rye bread too, and eat it, as I do, with our thoughts turned toward our Father’s house and to the things we heard and saw there.
And believe me
Your most loving and affectionate brother
Vincent
And pray: Lord, bless this food!
Herewith Ecce Homo, send me Mater Dolorosa. Adieu, old boy, a handshake in thought.
