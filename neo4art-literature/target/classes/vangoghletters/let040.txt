Paris, 13 August 1875
My dear Theo,
I had wanted to write to you earlier. I’m glad that Pa has accepted the call to Etten; under the circumstances I also think it good that Willemien is going along with Anna. I’d also have liked to be with all of you that Sunday at Helvoirt; have I already told you that I was with Soek and his family at Ville-d’Avray that day? I was surprised to find 3 paintings by Corot in the church there.
On Sunday last and Sunday a fortnight ago I went to Mr Mercier’s church and heard him speak on ‘all things work together for good to them that love God’ (in Dutch it says ‘for those who love God all things will work together for good’) and on ‘He created man in his own image’, it was glorious and grand. You should also go to church every Sunday if you can, even if it isn’t so very beautiful;
  do that, you won’t regret it. Have you ever been to hear the Rev. Zubli?
In the list of what I have hanging in my room I forgot:
N. Maes  	The nativity
Hamon	 	‘If I were sombre winter’
Ed. Frère	 	The seamstresses
 	A cooper
Français	 	Last fine day
Ruipérez	 	The imitation of Jesus Christ
Bosboom	 	Cantabimus and psallemus 
I’m doing my best to find another engraving of ‘Rembrandt, Reading the Bible’ for you, perhaps I’ll be sending it to you in the first crate of paintings. Have I sent you a lithograph of Troyon, Morning effect? Français, Last fine days? If not, write and tell me; I have two of each. And now, I wish you well, do right and don’t look back, as much as you can, and believe me ever
Your loving brother
Vincent
Please give my regards to Mr and Mrs Tersteeg and Mauve, also my regards to the Van Stockums, Haanebeeks, Aunt Fie, Rooses, &amp;c. What do you think about our Anna?
