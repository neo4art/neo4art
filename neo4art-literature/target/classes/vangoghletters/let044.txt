Letter|Paris, 4 Sept. 75
My dear Theo,
I’m sending you herewith my letter for Ma’s birthday, please enclose it with yours. I’ve bought a book about Michel, with etchings after his paintings; I’ll send it to you as soon as I’ve finished it. Michel, though, isn’t nearly so beautiful as that landscape described in that passage in Adam Bede, which we both found so moving. Bonington,
  too, almost painted it, and yet that isn’t it either.
When you’ve finished the book I’d like to ask you to give it in my name to Uncle Cor to read, when you have the opportunity of course, though I’m giving it to you. I see the paintings themselves, so naturally you can have the description and etchings after them.
My regards to the Haanebeeks, Carbentuses, Van Stockums, Mauve, Rooses &amp;c. if the occasion presents itself. I wish you the very best. Ever
Your loving brother
Vincent
Give the book on Michel to Mr Tersteeg to read, too.
