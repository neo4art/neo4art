Letter|Schenkweg 14 March.
Dear Mr de Zwart,
Last Monday I paid Giesenberg not only the 4.60 guilders due that day but also a further 10 guilders.
In accordance with the matter dealt with in my letter of last month with regard to the attic room.
May I now count on your kind consideration in respect of fitting it up efficiently?
Otherwise leaving it to you, naturally, to decide how you want to do it.
I respectfully remain,
Your servant
Vincent van Gogh.
