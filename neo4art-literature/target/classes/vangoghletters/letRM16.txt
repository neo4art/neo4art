Letter|My dear ,
Please write to my brother that he should maintain the prices for your paintings rather than offering them for less.
It’s no easier to sell them if they’re cheaper, nor is it more difficult to sell them for more, take my word for it, if you can sell them at all.
I hadn’t wanted to write you about this, preferring instead to talk to you at length about it.
I’m very busy at the moment: I’m working on half a dozen canvases of 30 square, to be used to decorate the house. There are three canvases of the public garden, 4. ploughed fields [x] [the starry night [?]]
