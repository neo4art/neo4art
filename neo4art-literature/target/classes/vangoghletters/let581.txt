Letter|My dear Vincent,
I wanted to write to your brother but I know you see each other every day and I’m afraid to trouble him, occupied as he is with business from morning till night.
I have left to work in Brittany (always the rage to paint), and I had high hopes of having funds for that. The little I’ve sold went to pay off some pressing debts, and in a month I’m going to find myself with nothing. Zero
  is a negative power.
I don’t want to put pressure on your brother, but a brief word from you on this subject would set my mind at rest, or at least enable me to hold on. My God, how terrible these money matters are for an artist!
And if we have to make some reductions don’t worry, as long as I find some funds. I’ve just spent a fortnight in bed, struck down again by fever, and I’m getting back to work. If I can eke things out for
  5 or 6 months I think I’ll bring back some good canvases.
A word of encouragement in reply if possible.
Ever yours,
Paul Gauguin
