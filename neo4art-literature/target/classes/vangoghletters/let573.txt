Letter|Paris, 1 Sept. 1887.
Dear Sir,
Your Honour will remember that when I left Nuenen with the intention of coming back to Holland, it was sufficient for me to take a notice of removal with me (to Antwerp) — (see 23 November 1885).
My travel plans having wholly changed, and wishing to register myself in Paris, the paper Your Honour gave me is only sufficient temporarily. And so I hereby request you simply to send me a domestic passport, which together with the notice of removal to Antwerp is sufficient proof of my identity.
Would you be so kind as to send this paper to my ’s address:
Nieuwe Ginnekenstraat Breda
 
or directly to my address:
V.W. van Gogh
54 rue Lepic Paris.
Thanking Your Honour in advance for your trouble, I remain, yours faithfully,
Your Honour’s obedient servant
Vincent W. van Gogh
