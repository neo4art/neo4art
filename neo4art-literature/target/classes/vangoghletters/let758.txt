Letter|My dear Theo,
I’m rather surprised that you haven’t written to me once these last few days. However, like the previous time when you went to Holland, it’s above all sheer chance.
Now I hope that all these things have gone well for you.
In the meantime I’ve been obliged to ask Tasset for 10 metres of canvas and a few tubes.
Also I still need

I have 6 spring studies, including two large orchards. It’s very urgent, because these effects are so fleeting.
 
So write to me by return. I’ve taken an apartment of 2 small rooms at 6 (or 8 francs a month, water included) which belong to Mr Rey. It’s certainly not expensive, but not nearly as nice as the other studio.
But to be able to move home and send you a consignment of canvases I would have to pay the other . And that’s why I was more or less stunned that you hadn’t sent me anything. But anyway.
Hoping again that all those marriage matters went off to your liking, wishing you and your lots of happiness with all my heart
Ever yours,
Vincent
Signac has asked me to join him in Cassis, but seeing as we have enough expenses without that, whatever I do or you do it isn’t within our means.
