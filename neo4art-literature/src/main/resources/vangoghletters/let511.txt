Letter|Dear Sir,
I’ve finished two paintings — if you’d like to come and look at them with Van de Wakker on Sunday — very well.
Since I’ll also have finished others before long — if you want to wait — also very well.
Wanted to tell you, though, as agreed — I’m busy and can’t easily get away, as you observe. If you do come either Sunday or later — would you just tell Van der Harten, who wants to come and see my birds’ nests. Sincerely, with a handshake,
Yours truly,
Vincent
When you’re coming, please advise on a postcard.
