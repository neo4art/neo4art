Letter|[Letterhead: Goupil Paris]
My dear Theo,
Thanks for your last letter and for the poem by Rückert.
On Sunday I went again to Mr Bersier, his sermon was based on the text ‘It is not lawful for thee’, he concluded with ‘Happy are they for whom life has all its thorns’.
Here are some words which I know Uncle Vincent is very fond of:
‘Rejoice, young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgement. Remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.
Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh,
  when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them.’ Yet I find even more beautiful:
‘Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.’ And ‘Thy will be done’ and ‘Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil’.
Herewith a note for Mr Tersteeg, asking him if he would frame 2 engravings, ‘Good Friday’ and ‘St Augustine’, which you’ll find in the next crate. And will you please be so kind as to send them to Helvoirt around 10 Sept. I’d really like them to be from both of us, so that you pay 2.50 guilders towards the frames. I told Mr Tersteeg that you’d write and tell me what they cost and then I’d send him the money. You can give me the 2.50 guilders when we see each other. That probably won’t be before Christmas; I believe it’s better not to ask for any time off before then. This evening I’m going to dine with Mr Hamman. Adieu, write again soon, and believe me
Your loving brother
Vincent
