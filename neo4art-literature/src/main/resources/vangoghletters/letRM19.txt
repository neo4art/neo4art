Letter|My dear ,
For a few days now I would have liked to reply to your kind letter, which I received while still in St-Rémy. Things weren’t working out there any more, and I was becoming rather iller through the treatment.
In Paris it was a great joy for me to see Theo again and to meet Jo and the one. Jo made an excellent impression upon me, she’s charming and very simple and good. Yes it really seems to me to be going as well as possible for the moment.
And as for myself, for the moment I still fear the noise and the bustle of Paris and I left immediately for the country – to an old village.
Here there are roofs of mossy thatch which are superb, and of which I’ll certainly do something.
 
Then I think that the to whom I’ve been recommended will absolutely let me be as if nothing were wrong.
In the last few days at St-Rémy I worked in a frenzy. Big bouquets of flowers, violet irises, big bouquets of roses. Landscapes.
It was odd to see all my canvases from the beginning again, from the time I left.
But I would very much have liked you to have seen the olive groves that I’ve brought with me now, with yellow, pink, blue skies, quite different, I think that these are canvases that haven’t yet been painted like this. Up to now the others always painted them in grey.
 
I was very pleased to see the exhibition at the Champ de Mars, where there are many things I like a lot.
