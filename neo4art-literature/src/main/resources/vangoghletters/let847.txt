31 January 1890
My dear Vincent,
Dr Peyron writes to me that you have again been seized by an attack of your illness. My poor brother, I’m infinitely sorry that things aren’t going as they should. Fortunately, the previous times this didn’t
  last long, and so we hope with all possible fervour that you may soon be better this time too. It’s the only cloud in our happiness, for my dear brother, the bad moment for Jo is over. She has brought into the world a fine who cries a lot but who seems to be in good health. My poor little wife suffered a great deal because the waters broke too soon, but fortunately we had an excellent doctor with extraordinary patience, for any other in his place would
  certainly have used the forceps. Jo is very well and hasn’t yet had any fever, but it could still come.
The is already beginning to cry lustily. How happy I’d be if in a while, when Jo’s well again, you’ll be able to come and see her and see our little one! As we told you, we’ll name him after you, and I’m making the wish that he may be as determined and as courageous as you. As soon as you can,
  write to me to tell me how you are and if there were any incidents that provoked the new crisis.
We often talk about you and we think about you even more. I hope with all my heart that you may soon be better.
Be of good heart and
Ever yours,
Theo
