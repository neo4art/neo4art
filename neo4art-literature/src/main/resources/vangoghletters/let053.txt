Letter|[Letterhead: Goupil Paris]
Paris, 30 Sept. 1875.
My dear Theo,
Herewith the book about Michel that I promised you, also an etching after the Margaret by Scheffer and a lithograph after Corot, and a package of chocolate.
I do know that things aren’t easy for you at the moment, old chap, but remain steadfast and be brave; ‘Not to dream, not to sigh’ is also necessary sometimes.
You know ‘that you are not alone but that the Father is with you’. I shake your hand heartily in thought. Ever,
Your loving brother
Vincent
Please keep the enclosed etching after Rembrandt, along with the photos of the Corot and the Jules Breton sent previously, until Pa and Ma are comfortably settled in Etten, and send them then, at the end of November for example.
