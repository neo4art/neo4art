Letter|Sunday evening, 5 May 1889
Having to go away tomorrow and being busy on Tuesdays, I place myself at your disposal to accompany you to St-Rémy on Wednesday. We would leave by the 8.51 train, if that suits you. Having already seen Mr Peyron, it is appropriate that I should accompany you myself.
Yours truly,
Salles
