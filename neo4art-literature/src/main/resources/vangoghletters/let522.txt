Letter|My dear Theo,
Just a word to bid you good-day. I hope it will be convenient for you and your friend Bonger to look in on me this afternoon before you eat, so — let’s say between 3 and 5.
I thought this would perhaps work out best — since then they’ll still have you at home the whole evening. I’m rather busy, since they’re harvesting the wheat in the fields and, as you know, this takes only a few days and is certainly almost the most beautiful of all.
But I’ll make sure to be in my studio today between 3 and 5. In the evening I’ll drop in at Ma’s for a talk.
But for the rest, you mustn’t take it amiss of me if I keep on working.
With a handshake.
Yours truly,
Vincent
