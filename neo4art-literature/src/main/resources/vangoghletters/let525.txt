Letter|My dear Uncle,
Since Theo is coming to see you and I have a request to make of you, I’m taking this opportunity to ask you the following. If you would permit me to come and see your paintings I haven’t seen any paintings for a long time, and long so much to see some that I’m overlooking everything to ask this of you.
Theo has two small studies of mine with him – the colour of both is colder than I should like. I have two others of the same size that are warmer.
If you perhaps have any old grooved frames that you don’t have an immediate use for, I should like very much to trade one of these 4 studies for a frame.
Respectfully,
Your servant
Vincent
