Letter|London, 20 Nov. 1873.
Dearest Caroline,
I wish you many happy returns; it will surely be a festive day, this first birthday in your own house. I hope that this will be a very good and happy year for you both.
You’ve received my last letter, I hope. Write soon with news of how everyone is doing. I’m longing
  to hear something again.
Have you seen Theo yet? I heard that he arrived in The Hague last Wednesday.
Herewith a small contribution for the album.
I’m fine, but I’m up to my ears in work, and only have a moment.
Bid good-day to everyone in the Poten; how I’d like to look in on you today. I wish you both the best.
Yours truly,
Vincent.
