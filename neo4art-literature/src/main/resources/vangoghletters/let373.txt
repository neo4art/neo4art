Letter|My dear Theo,
I’ve just received a letter from home (please thank Pa for it, I hadn’t had the letter when I wrote), and I gather you plan to leave Breda at 2.15 on Friday. If there’s any change in your travel plans, let me know, and I’ll meet your train. Because if you’re in a hurry we must make sure not to let slip any time when we can be together. I’m working on a painted sketch for potato grubbers. I hope it comes off. I’m longing to see you, have a pleasant time, with a handshake.
Ever yours,
Vincent
Look closely at the fields in Brabant, what they’re doing there. And try to take a look at the interior of a weaver’s cottage in the village to see whether they aren’t beautiful things.
