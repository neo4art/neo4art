# Neo4Art - Journal: March, 1st 2015

Today we spent some hours trying to populate some interesting entities:

* Colours
* Emotions
* Animals

Those entities are of course common themes for every artist and art in general,
and `Neo4Art search engine` will use these entities to find topics you could be interested in.

## Todo

Other entities we want to populate are:

* Places
* Cities
* Churches
* Objects
* Museums
* Exhibitions

## Bold Thanks!

**If you like our idea, please consider to become one contributor of this project!**
